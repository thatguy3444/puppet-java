Java Exercise: Bounded Producer Consumer Queue

This is the submission for Theodore Smith.

My implementation of the ProducerConsumerQueue interface is in the ProducerConsumerConcurrentQueue class.

In addition to this primary implementation, I included a set of tests and benchmarks and a few other (less efficient) implementations that I wrote in com.theodorersmith.queue.test. 

I also added a simple console test interface to run the requested 5/5 thread test. It also includes options to run a more complete set of tests and benchmarks on the primary implementation and my other test implementations (including java concurrent collection reference implementations). 

To run the console interface, please use com.theodorersmith.queue.ProducerConsumerTestInterface as your main class.
