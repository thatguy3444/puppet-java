Java Exercise: Bounded Producer Consumer Queue

This is the submission for Theodore Smith.

My implementation of the ProducerConsumerQueue interface is in the ProducerConsumerConcurrentQueue class.

In addition to this primary implementation, I included a few other (less efficient) implementations and a simple set of tests and benchmarks in com.theodorersmith.queue.test. 

I also added a simple console test interface to run the requested 5/5 thread test. It also includes options to run a more complete set of tests and benchmarks on the primary implementation and my other test implementations (including java concurrent collection reference implementations). To run the console interface, please use ProducerConsumerTestInterface as your main class.
